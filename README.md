# **School Management System**

This is an application to generate ID numbers and mock-emails for students. This application grants users access to a list of students that were inputted into this system. 

**This application:**
- Creates and saves a text file with a list of the students inputted by the user 
- Generates an ID number and a mock-email for each student.
- Users are able to search for a specific student to access their ID and email. 

## Motivation and Importance
My motivation for creating an application that keeps track of a list of current students was my previous experience as a school teacher.
When a teacher has a new class, it can be really useful to have a list of their students with associated information for each student as a way of organizing their activities.
I can see teachers using this application to call on students based on their class ID number or pair students up based on their ID numbers. 

## Lessons
This project allowed me to practice some fundamental back-end skills and challenged me to solve many front-end problems as this application is all run through a GUI. 

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java SE 23
2. Open GUI package and run GUITest.java
